## Personal Interests

I enjoy reading books, they've had a significant impact on how I approach software development. Some of my favorites are:

- **“Design Patterns” by the Gang of Four** - for it's influence on my understanding of reusable design solutions.

- **“Clean Architecture” by Robert C. Martin** - for it's influence on how I think about designing scalable and maintainable architecture.

- **“The Clean Coder” by Robert C. Martin** - for it's influence on my mindset around responsibility, communication, and professionalism as a developer.
